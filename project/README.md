# File sort utility 
#### video url : https://youtu.be/QbII2siGwgI
#### Description: This small utility project was build for those who have a bad time managing file like me. The utility scans a specified folder and finds out the type of files and create folder according to the type of file [audio,application,video,image,text] and move them there. using the utility we can significanty reduce the time for skimming through dumps of files. The program starts by calling the main() function, which then calls three other functions: get_loc(), folder_exist(), and stem(). get_loc() retrieves the path of the directory to be cleaned. If the path is not provided as a command-line argument it defaults to the Downloads folder [home/{user}/Downloads]. The function then checks if the directory exists and if it does not the script exits with an error message (File not found) . folder_exist() creates subfolders for different file types - audio, application, video, image, and text - in the directory specified by get_loc() if they do not already exist.stem() uses the iterdir() method of the pathlib.Path to iterate over all the files in the directory and identify their type using the python-magic module. The function then moves each file to its appropriate folders using the shutil.move() function. Finally, the function prints a message to indicate the successful completion of the script(Done, This Was CS50!).

how can we improve the program :
- Make the program ask for default location when running for the frist time and storing the location inside a binary file for security
- only make folder for file that actually exist (make audio folder only if the audio folders are available)
